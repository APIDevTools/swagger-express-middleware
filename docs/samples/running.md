* [Walkthrough](walkthrough1.md)
    + __Running the sample__
    + [JavaScript Walkthrough](javascript.md)
    + [Swagger Pet Store Homepage](html.md)
    + [YAML Walkthrough](yaml.md)


Running the sample
--------------------------
To run the sample, you'll need to `cd` to the `samples` directory and then run [sample1.js](../../samples/sample1.js) in Node.  Here's how to do that:

````bash
cd node_modules/swagger-express-middleware/samples
node sample1.js
````

You should see a message telling you that the Swagger Pet Store is now running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Open that link in your web browser, and you should see the following page:

If you see that page, then you're ready to move-on to the next part of the walkthrough...
